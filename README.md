### 3n + 1
- A math problem that no one has found a solid solution yet.
- It is just a function that doubles the number if it is even or triples and adds one if it is odd.
  When the number becomes one, it stops
- In fact, there is no solid prove that all numbers end on one, on the other hand no counters exemples were found either.
- The code just counts how many operations were made on an initial number typed by the user.
